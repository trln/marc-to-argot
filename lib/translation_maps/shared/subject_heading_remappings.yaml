# Specifies remappings for problematic LCSH
# Headings to remap must be specified at the whole subdivision level.
# Only entire subfield values are replaced. For example:
#  $aPoor$xMedical care -> Poor people -- Medical care
# BUT:
#  $aPoor children$xMedical care DOES NOT GET REMAPPED
# This requires some repetition here in the mappings, but it is clearer and safer
